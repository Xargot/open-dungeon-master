// The pass (src/lib/dm/setup.ts) runs when the adventure begins, at a table
// the AI narrates (an assisted table included), with the setting on and no
// secret outline written yet. A Workshop Storyboard imported before that
// writes the table's story arc; the pass then writes a premise, an opening
// scene and an outline of its own beside it. The arc is not overwritten
// (the arc planner skips a table that has one, and the DM prompt prefers
// it), but the opening scene goes into every prompt alongside the arc.
